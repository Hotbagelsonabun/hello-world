# hello-world
The first repository

Hello! Samson here...

The reason I'm here, is to learn how to use coding as a tool to create things, like a means
towards an end. In this case, I ultimately desire to make something like a journalling
application. In order to do that, I have to make a program, meaning I have to learn how to
piece together the program in a chosen programming language. I'm here to learn a language,
and to practice until I git gud, and I keep hearing about people using Github... for something...

I'll learn about it more in time

To all who are reading I hope things work out!
